abstract: "In this study, we examine how corporate innovation and the degree of
  ambidexterity affect current and future firm performance. We develop a novel
  text-based innovation measure based on 10K reports that is particularly
  applicable to non-R&D industries. Our text-based innovation measure
  successfully captures innovative firms operating at the 3-digit SIC level in
  the retail industry. We find that both novelty and efficiency matter for firm
  performance, however they affect firm performance in different dimensions and
  over different periods. We find that innovative firms experience higher and
  persistent future sales growth, show better market performance and enjoy a
  higher future profit margin. In addition, we apply textual analysis on firms’
  10K filings to distinguish firms’ exploration and exploitation activities,
  i.e., the degree of ambidexterity. Consistent with the organizational theory
  developed by March (1991), we find that firms’ exploration activities are
  positively associated with future profit margin, while exploitation activities
  are positively associated with asset turnover. The balance of these two
  investments has a positive effect on both current and future return on net
  operating assets. We validate our text-based measures using firms in the
  R&D-intensive electronic equipment industry and show that the main results are
  robust to additions of various control variables. We contribute to the textual
  analysis literature in accounting by showing the usefulness of 10K reports in
  assessing a firm’s degree of innovation, as well as to the innovation
  management literature by providing a large sample-based measure to identify
  innovative products and services that explains current and future firm
  performance.  Our study has implications for recent debates by the SEC on the
  update of Regulation S-K Items and the IASB Management Commentary project to
  improve the readability of filings and discourage disclosure of non-material
  information. "
