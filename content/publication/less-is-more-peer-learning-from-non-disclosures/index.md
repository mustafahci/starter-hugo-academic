abstract: The US Securities and Exchange Commission requires US public firms to
  disclose their material agreements while allowing them to redact/omit
  proprietary information from these contracts due to competitive harm. In this
  paper, I investigate whether firms can extract valuable information from
  rivals' redacted disclosures to use in their subsequent investment decisions.
  Despite well-documented spillover effects of disclosures between peers,
  relatively little is known about firm response to rivals' non-disclosure or
  censorship behavior. Consistent with peer learning from redacted disclosures,
  I find that firms increase their R&D spending and become more similar to
  redacting peers. I also explore the underlying *mechanism* how redacted
  disclosures manifest in firm learning. Using the EDGAR server logs, I find
  that redacted material agreements are downloaded up to 52% more than their
  unredacted counterparts, indicating greater attention and information demand
  for redacted disclosures. Using two different quasi-natural experiments, I
  show that increased *peer attention* to redacted disclosures might be a
  potential mechanism that explains peer learning. My study contributes to the
  literature on corporate investment under uncertainty and adds to our
  understanding regarding the underlying mechanisms of peer learning documented
  in the literature.
