abstract: We examine whether the simultaneous release of information affects
  managers' ability to gather decision-relevant information from market prices.
  We use the plausibly exogenous timing of patent grant disclosures by the
  United States Patent and Trademark Office as a source of variation in the
  simultaneous release of value-relevant information. We find that the market's
  response to patent grants is more informative for managerial decisions if the
  firm receives fewer patent grants on the same day. This effect is more
  pronounced for patents that relate to relatively more risky innovative
  strategies for which feedback is arguably more important. Firms with more
  distinct information releases also produce more valuable and higher quality
  innovations in the future. Our results suggest that bundling the release of
  multiple pieces of information at once potentially impedes managers' ability
  to benefit from the market's feedback.
