I am a PhD candidate in Accounting at Tilburg University School of Economics and Management.  I hold a Research Master in Accounting degree from Tilburg University and a Master of Science in Finance degree from Bilkent University. I am interested in empirical financial accounting research, particularly in the fields of corporate disclosure and innovation. I examine whether companies disclose their innovative qualities through various mediums and whether these disclosures are well received by capital markets. I apply textual analysis techniques to extract information from corporate disclosures.
