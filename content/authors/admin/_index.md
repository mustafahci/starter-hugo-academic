I am Assistant Professor of Accounting at the Rotterdam School of Management. I obtained my PhD degree from Tilburg University. During my Phd, I had the privilege of visiting Columbia Business School in New York as a visiting scholar. I am passionate about disclosure research; particularly on the real effects of corporate disclosures. My research currently examines the effects of corporate disclosures on capital markets, firms, and competitors.

I am interested in data science and actively use textual analysis techniques to extract and collect information from corporate disclosures or web sources.

I am a PhD candidate in Accounting at Tilburg University School of Economics and Management. I hold a Research Master in Accounting degree from Tilburg University and a Master of Science in Finance degree from Bilkent University. I am interested in empirical financial accounting research, particularly in the fields of corporate disclosures and innovation. I am passionate about disclosure research: the content or new ways of interaction and communication. I currently examine the real effects of disclosures, particularly innovation-related dissclosures, on capital markets, firms and even on rivals.
